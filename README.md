- Hi, I’m @wereinwild
- I’m interested in atmospheric chemistry, climate change, air pollution, and the health impacts of air pollution.
- I’m researching statistical methods to identify sources of air pollution.
- I aim to help the air pollution and earth sciences community by publishing Python programs to ease the interface with commonly used APIs.
- The website of my institute is: weizmann.ac.il
